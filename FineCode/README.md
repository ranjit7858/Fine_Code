<!-- ABOUT THE PROJET -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: Problem Statement</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  In the present senerio the instructors cannot judge or analyse the individual students code due to the large number of students in a class. This leads to the student not knowing their standing among their peers as well as does't give the student or the instructor any information regarding the analysis of code.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :cloud: About the Project / Solution</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  Our Project 'FineCode' focuses on building logic over theory. The platform would allow multiple students to register and submit codes for a given question set by the instructor. The code will then be evaluated based on various parameters depicted visually and then ranked among the students. Giving the instructor as well as the student valuable information regarding the code through analysis when compared with the others.
